; Just run

 (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'unicalc)

; with your Lisp session started in the directory where the source files are
; located and then maybe something like

 (use-package 'unicalc)

; . If you want some test cases just type

 (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'test-universal-algebra)

; If you have still no clue, then just LOAD this file via
; (load "INSTALL")
; where INSTALL is in the same directory where you started your Lisp session.
